> A simple Cookiecutter template to quickly bootstrap a new python project

## Features

- Always up-to-date dependencies with the help of [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/)
- Python 3.6+
- Testing using [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
- Uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) for dependency management
- Continuous Integration options: [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) or [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
- Pre-commit hooks via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) courtesy of the [Commitizen tool](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen), which is also useful for:
  - Bumping versions automatically using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) based on the commits
  - Generating a changelog using [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
- Code formatting using [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Linting using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- Choice of various licenses
- Optional CLI using [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) or [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
- Generates a simple [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) `settings.json` (Just change the `python.pythonPath`)

## Getting started

Ensure that you have [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed on your computer:

```sh
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Bootstrap your new python project:

```sh
cookiecutter https://github.com/engineervix/cookiecutter-pyproject.git
```

You'll be prompted for some values, such as **project_name**, **project_slug**, **email**, **license**, etc.

Once you're done, `cd` into your the new project folder created above, and you're ready to roll :sunglasses:!

### Other steps

- Create a virtual environment for your project
- Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pre-commit install`
- `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
- add any additional requirements in the `requirements.in` file, then
  - `pip-compile requirements.in` to generate an updated `requirements.txt` file
  - `pip-sync` to update your virtual environment to reflect exactly what's in the `requirements.txt` file.

It goes without saying that you'll want to create a repo for your new project. If you're using *Circle CI*, ensure that you add your repo to your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) account. Optionally register your repo with [dependabot](https://app.dependabot.com/), [requires.io](https://requires.io), [coveralls](https://coveralls.io), [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) and [deepsource](https://deepsource.io/) (Don't forget to add the Code Climate, Coveralls and Deepsource Environment Variables to your Project's Settings in your CircleCI Dashboard). If you don't want to use any of these services

- remove them (coveralls, codeclimate and deepsource) from the CircleCI configuration file
- remove the respective badges in your project's `README.md` file

### Tests

Simply run `pytest`. For more detailed output, including test coverage:

```sh
pytest -vv --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```
